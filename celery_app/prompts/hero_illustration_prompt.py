Please analyze this image and generate a JSON object containing the top left pixel coordinates of a crop box that crops the face of the character you see in the image. Respond with only valid JSON data to import. The JSON keys to include are 'x', 'y', 'width', and 'height'. The thumbnail crop should be a 1:1 square image framing the character's entire face. Ensure the crop coordinates are proportional to the resolution of the image. Calculate x, y, width, and height values such that their resulting crop box would not exceed 500x500px and covers the face of the character in the image's original resolution, which is " + str(original_img.size[0]) + "x" + str(original_img.size[1]) + " pixels. Determine the resolution of the image you're looking at, and multiply the values by how much the resolution has been downscaled in the version of the image you're looking at.
